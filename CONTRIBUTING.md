# Contributing to PolicyFingerprint™ (PF-AI)

First off, thank you for your interest in helping build the standard for deterministic AI governance! 

We believe that **Identity for Autonomy** is the most critical security frontier in the agentic era. While our core implementation (the PSH engine and Veto Layer) is currently in a **Closed-Build Phase**, we invite the community to help us refine the specification and architectural standards.

---

## 🛡️ Our Current Focus
We are not currently accepting Pull Requests (PRs) for source code. Instead, we are looking for contributions in the following areas:

1. **RFC & Specification:** Help us define the metadata standards for the Policy State Hash (PSH) to ensure it is robust across various industries (FinTech, MedTech, etc.).
2. **Integration Patterns:** Documenting how a Deterministic Veto layer should interface with frameworks like OpenClaw, LangChain, or AutoGPT.
3. **Threat Modeling:** Identifying specific "Semantic Escape" or "Identity Spoofing" scenarios that the PolicyFingerprint standard must address.

## 🚦 Rules of Engagement

### 1. Opening Issues
Please use Issues to:
* **Propose a Feature:** Suggest a new field for the Policy Bundle (e.g., "Geographical Execution Bounds").
* **Report a Concept Gap:** Identify a scenario where the current 3-layer integrity model might face challenges.
* **Ask a Question:** Clarify the mechanics of PSH canonicalization or Merkle selective disclosure.

### 2. The "No Unsolicited PRs" Policy
Because the core engine is proprietary and under development, **please do not submit Pull Requests containing code.** * PRs for documentation improvements or schema definitions (JSON/YAML) are welcome. 
* Unsolicited code PRs will be closed without review to protect our development roadmap and IP boundaries.

### 3. Professional Conduct
As a project focused on "Legitimacy and Identity," we expect all contributors to maintain a high level of professional discourse. Focus on technical merits, security proofs, and architectural integrity.
